## Memory first

Redis keeps the active data set in RAM, removing disk latency from the hot path.

## Event loop

A mostly single-threaded execution model avoids lock contention for core operations.

```tsx
while (true) {
  const events = waitForSockets();
  for (const event of events) executeCommand(event);
}
```

## Tradeoffs

Heavy commands can block progress, memory is finite, and persistence/replication choices affect behavior under failure. For latency intuition behind those tradeoffs, see [Latency Numbers Every Developer Should Know](/systems/latency-numbers-every-dev-should-know).
