## Expose state clearly

Show syncing / pending status instead of pretending writes are instantly global.

## Use idempotency keys

Retries are inevitable; idempotency prevents duplicate side effects.

## Resolve conflicts deterministically

Choose domain rules for merges and keep conflict outcomes predictable. For the consistency/availability tradeoff behind these patterns, read [CAP Theorem in Practice](/classics/cap-theorem-in-practice).
